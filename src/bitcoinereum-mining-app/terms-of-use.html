            </p><h2>5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND RISKS</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Warranty disclaimer</h3>
            You expressly understand and agree that your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service (including the Service
            and the Content) are provided on an “AS IS” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind, either
            express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose or non-infringement. You acknowledge that Minebtcm has no control over, and no duty to take any action
            regarding: which users gain access to or use the Service; what effects the Content may have on you; how you may
            interpret or use the Content; or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content.
            You release Minebtcm from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Service.
            Minebtcm makes no representations concerning any Content contained in or accessed through the Service, and Minebtcm
            will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained
            in or accessed through the Service.

            <h3>5.2 Sophistication and Risk of Cryptographic Systems</h3>
            By utilizing the Service or interacting with the Content or platform in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent
            risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies
            of native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those
            that follow the Ethereum Token Standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20), and blockchain-based software
            systems.

            <h3>5.3 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</h3>
            Minebtcm and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit
            the ability of Minebtcm to continue to develop, or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use
            the Service or Ethereum blockchain.

            <h3>5.4 Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography</h3>
            You acknowledge and understand that Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances
            such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies and Services of Content, which
            could result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. To the extent possible, Minebtcm
            intends to update the protocol underlying Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate
            additional security measures, but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system. By using
            the Service or accessing Content, you acknowledge these inherent risks.

            <h3>5.5 Volatility of Crypto Currencies</h3>
            You understand that Ethereum and other blockchain technologies and associated currencies or tokens are highly volatile due
            to many factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge
            that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to
            any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. You acknowledge these risks and represent that Minebtcm
            cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.

            <h3>5.6 Application Security</h3>
            You acknowledge that Ethereum applications are code subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for
            evaluating any code provided by the Services or Content and the trustworthiness of any third-party websites,
            products, smart-contracts, or Content you access or use through the Service. You further expressly acknowledge
            and represent that Ethereum applications can be written maliciously or negligently, that Minebtcm cannot be held
            liable for your interaction with such applications and that such applications may cause the loss of property
            or even identity. This warning and others later provided by Minebtcm in no way evidence or represent an on-going
            duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Service or Content.

        <p></p>

        <p>
            </p><h2>6. Indemnity</h2>

            as well as the officers, directors, employees, shareholders and representatives of any of the foregoing entities,
            from and against any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, costs (including attorneys’ fees and court
            costs) claims or actions of any kind whatsoever arising or resulting from your use of the Service, your violation

            the entire agreement between you and Minebtcm with respect to the Service and supersedes any prior agreements,
            oral or written, between you and Minebtcm. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the additional
            terms, rules and conditions of participation, the latter will prevail over the Terms to the extent of the conflict.

            <h3>12.2 Waiver and Severability of Terms</h3>

            The failure of Minebtcm to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
            right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction
            to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to
            the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force
            and effect.

            <h3>12.3 Statute of Limitations</h3>
